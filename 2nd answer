There are two possible solutions to handle the big data,these are scale up and scale out.scale up: 
1.It increase the configuration of single file system like disk capacity,RAM, speed and data transfer,etc.
but it is costly,complex and time consuming process.
2. it is a monolithic system.

scale out: 1.use multiple commodity machines and distribute the load among these machines.
 quickly implements its solution among its machines. it is not monolithic system instead increases its number of machines.
